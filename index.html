                <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
                <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It's a condition where the
                    body either doesn't produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels) or can't
                    effectively use the insulin it produces. This leads to high blood sugar levels, which can cause a
                    range of symptoms and complications if left untreated.</p>
                <p>Diabetes is a serious condition that requires ongoing management and care to prevent complications
                    and maintain a healthy quality of life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
                <p>There are several types of diabetes, including type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational
                    diabetes, and LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults). Each type of diabetes has different
                    causes, symptoms, and treatment options.</p>
                <p>Understanding the different types of diabetes is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. It's
                    important to work with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your
                    specific condition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Symptoms and Complications</h2>
                <p>The symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type of diabetes and the individual affected.
                    Common symptoms include increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, blurred vision, fatigue,
                    and slow healing of cuts and wounds.</p>
                <p>If left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, kidney damage,
                    nerve damage, blindness, and limb amputation. It's important to work with your healthcare provider
                    to manage your condition and prevent complications.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Prevention and Management</h2>
                <p>The good news is that diabetes can be prevented and managed with lifestyle changes and medication. A
                    healthy diet that is low in sugar and saturated fats, regular exercise such as walking or swimming,
                    maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular check-ups with your doctor can all help to prevent
                    and manage diabetes.</p>
                <p>Working with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized plan for managing your diabetes is
                    crucial for achieving optimal health outcomes. With the right treatment and self-care, it's possible
                    to live a healthy and fulfilling life with diabetes.</p>
