  - he home page provides an overview of diabetes, its types (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational), symptoms, complications  and prevention and management strategies.

- __The Footer__ 

 - The footer section provides links to our social media profiles, which will open in a new tab to ensure easy navigation for the user. This section is valuable to the user as it encourages them to stay connected with us through social media.


### Features Left to Implement

- Backend code for sending mail functionality at the contact page
- JavaScript code to improve user-friendly design and user experience


## Testing 


I have thoroughly tested the website to ensure that it works as intended. Here are the results:

* I used [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML structure of the website. The result was "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

* I used [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the CSS code of the website. The result was "Congratulations! No Error Found."

* I tested the website using Google Chrome Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for measuring the quality of web pages. Here is a screenshot of the result:

I tested all features, including the contact form, social media links, and responsive design. I also tested the website on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).



During testing, I discovered some minor issues with broken links on the footer area and a video file on the contact page. These issues were fixed, and the website was tested again to confirm that it is in good condition.

Despite these minor issues, I am confident that our website provides an easy and straightforward way for users to access the information they need. We believe that our website meets the requirements specified in the project brief and is ready for launch.
